# Deathworlders Tweaks
 
Some stuff and things for a little web practice I've been doing.  
Will contain """backups""" of stories written by people on the HFY subreddit.  

The `ConvertTXTtoJSON.py` file was just a prototype to automate converting the """backups""" into a new format.  
The same functionality exists at https://jordy3d.github.io/projects/jsonthing, which is nice
