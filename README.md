# Deathworlders Tweaks
 
Some stuff and things for a little web practice I've been doing.  
Will contain """backups""" of stories written by people on the HFY subreddit, among other things.

The """backups""" are JSON file conversions of the original text posts, converted using a quick tool I made at https://jordy3d.github.io/projects/jsonthing.  
These backups may have changes from the original posts to fix some formatting issues, but the content should be the same.

## Userscript
The userscript that makes use of this data can be installed easily at https://jordy3d.github.io/userscripts, or manually copied from https://github.com/Jordy3D/DeathworldersTweaks/blob/main/userscript/Deathworlders.user.js.  

### Features
- On-site Table of Contents featuring the Full Reading Order (incomplete at the moment, but hey)
- CSS Tweaks to the site
  - Fix some broken elements
  - Dark scrollbar
  - Fancy formatting for certain elements
  - Link highlighting
  - Paragraph justification
- Display the Chapter Cover at the top of the page on chapters that have one
- Hijack https://deathworlders.com/books/ to laod backups of off-site Full Reading Order chapters on the site

### To-Do
- [ ] Complete the Table of Contents
- [ ] Add support for searching and/or filtering the Table of Contents
- [ ] Fix some errors I saw once with some of the above tweaks that I haven't found again cuz I forgot which chapter they were on
