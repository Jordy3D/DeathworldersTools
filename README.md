# Deathworlders Tweaks
 
Some stuff and things for a little web practice I've been doing.  
Will contain """backups""" of stories written by people on the HFY subreddit, among other things.

The `ConvertTXTtoJSON.py` file was just a prototype to automate converting the """backups""" into a new format.  
A more up-to-date version exists at https://jordy3d.github.io/projects/jsonthing, which is nice.

## Userscript
The userscript that makes use of this data can be installed easily at https://jordy3d.github.io/userscripts, or manually copied from https://github.com/Jordy3D/DeathworldersTweaks/blob/main/userscript/Deathworlders.user.js.  

### Features
- On-site Table of Contents featuring the Full Reading Order (incomplete at the moment, but hey)
- CSS Tweaks to the site
  - Fix some broken elements
