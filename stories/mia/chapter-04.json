The arms had open bottoms and straps every few inches, so that the bottoms of the wearer’s arms would be exposed, to easily slip in and out of the suit. The tops of his forearms and biceps would be covered in what looked like a heavy stainless steel, which looked like it had some heavy pitting in it, likely from deflecting large debris raining down from welding machines. On the end of the arms, the hands looked like metal gauntlets with hinges in them, placed along the outside edge, that looked like they would swing open and attach to the back of the hands, allowing ungloved hands to do dexterity work.  His legs looked like they would be entirely encased. Heavy clasps along the outside edges of the legs were open and showing more straps that would be buckled around each leg once the leg was closed. The chest area had what looked like a rib cage which opened at the center outwards, allowing him to climb in and then close the rib cage over his body. Along where the base of the neck would have been, a large and heavy steel cowl extended up, close to where the skin of his neck would be and covered over the top of where his head would sit, but had a fully open face, so as not to obscure his vision."
