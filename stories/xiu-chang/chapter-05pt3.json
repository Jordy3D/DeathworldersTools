The bed was very comfortable… so much so that it was distracting, and she’d had to switch to the more familiar floor in order to fall asleep at all. As she’d done so, she’d glanced over at the lone human in the dim light of the room. Unlike the Gaoians, Xiù did not curl into a ball to sleep, but instead stretched out on her back on the floor, one arm tossed over her eyes. For some reason Triymin had half-expected her to growl or hiss as she slept, but instead she merely breathed silently in slow, deep breaths. She could almost feel the air pressure in the room fluctuate with each inhalation, though it was certainly her imagination."

Upon one of these pieces of equipment - a large, flat thing with a moving surface - was Xiù, facing away from the door and unaware of Triymin’s presence. The human was… running? The moving surface slid at a steady pace underneath her, and the other female kept up a steady pace to avoid being tossed off backwards, a pace Triymin could not have matched. Her arms and legs moved in unison, moving through the air and gravity with effortless grace. Unlike the clothes she’d worn the night before, which seemed to be adapted versions of Gaoian overalls, she wore more tight-fitting grey clothing that left her legs and arms bare."

Xiù’s pace was impressive enough, but it was her endurance that was awe-inspiring: she ran, and ran, and <i>ran</i>, far beyond the point where another being would be shattered.

Begin.” The computer obeyed, and Triymin’s eyes went wide as the device went faster and faster until Xiù was pelting along its surface at a breakneck pace.
